This is my first attempt of an independant project. I will try to clone the disign of google search page.

Day_1: I spent most of my time reviewing the basic rules of css and html elements and properties and then learning and understanding the concept of grid.
I felt very lost on how to start and understood the usefulness of looking at other's people code.
I also understood the dificulty of implementing the concepts that I learned and that I will need a lot of practise to get employment.
